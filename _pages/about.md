I am multidisciplinary dev who likes to dabble in everything, from design and
art to backends and Dev Ops. I studied Theoretical Physics at
university and have almost a decade of experience in software development.

I like learning new things and working on problems that matter ðŸŒ³

I love working with Flask. I also use Figma for all my designs, slides, etc.
In my spare time I like doing BJJ, coding for fun, film photography, gaming and snowboarding.

I am a native Bulgarian and English speaker and I am currently learning Spanish.
