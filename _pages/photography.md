I recently bought an `Olympus OM-1n` in an effort to try out ~~being a total hipster~~ some film photography. So far I've been shooting on `Kodak Gold 200 film` with the stock `Zuiko 50mm lens`.

I've come to realise that the camera's light meter must be off because a lot of my photos have been coming out dark.

Anyway, here's a collection of my _least crap_ shots.
