Whilst we were in the heart of Costa Rica, we couldn't miss going to the cloud forests of Monteverde. There isn't all that much else to do here so we knew we'd only be there for a few days. 

Santa Elena is a tiny town in the mountains of central Costa Rica,  but despite its small size it is well worth visiting. The main reason for coming here is to witness the magical forests in which tree crowns gently push through the low hanging clouds. 

As is the case with all rainforests, there is a tonne of wildlife to see here; we were very interested in seeing the gorgeous Resplendent Quetzal: a bird of paradise known for it's kaleidoscopic colours and wonderfully strange calls.

I will describe getting here from La Fortuna using 3 words: _jeep, boat, jeep_. You'll see advertisiments for this phrase, or equivalent, all over La Fortuna. It's the primary method of getting to Monteverde since it avoids going all the way around Lake Arenal, which can take an entire day. It consists of getting a shuttle from La Fortuna to Lake Arenal, then boarding a boat, then another shuttle to Santa Elena. It may sound like a hassle but the drive takes you through the peaks and troughs of the luscious mountains resulting in great views.

## The Cloudforest

If you read [Part 2](/2021-09-16/backpacking-in-costa-rica-part-2), you'll know that we met a guide called Sergio. He gave us the number of a friend of his, Eric, a fellow guide. In fact, Eric used to be a researcher and expert of the local area, having several species named after him. He was the old-school explorer-scholar type: his utilitarian khaki gilet had more pockets than you could count, each filled with a a tattered compendium of different endemic bird species. He was a shy, softly spoken man, I estmate in his late 60 or 70s, who lit up with energy whenever he spoke about the wildlife in the area.  I distinctly remember his grumbly half-monologue about new discoveries in the epigenome of two bird species previously thought to be different now considered the same, and how that simply made no sense to him. _"Too much hair-splitting"_, he'd say.

Though Eric didn't live in Santa Elena, he kindly picked us up from the main street and drove us to the Moteverde Reserve entrance. Tickets were $25 each and Eric's services cost us another $25 each, plus tips. Not cheap, but I highly recommend getting a guide because _they will_ spot the wildlife and _you won't_. Besides, quetzals are tricky to spot -- they're an ellusive, shy bird -- guides have telescopes/binoculars and they are trained in spotting wildlife. We came across a group of guides at the entrance (waiting for customers) all pointing their telescopes at the far treeline above: one of them had managed to spot a tiny rare snake in the dense crowns only because a bird "had been acting strange". 5 minutes later another group formed around a guide who spotted a rare beetle 30 meters up a tree branch. I had trouble seeing it even with a telescope.

Eric would spend some time walking silently before abruptly yet nonchalantly producing an extremely convincing bird call. He taught us that quetzals can do 8-10 different calls and he would demonstrate each one. These birds are highly intelligent and each one has its own twang or accent when singing.

He had an excellent story for us: a few years back, when he was stil an active guide, he worked alongside another colleague who never quite got the hang of some bird calls. One particular quetzal learned to immitate the guide's ersatz call and from then on the rest of the guides didn't know if they could hear their colleague or the quetzal's mimicry!

I remember expecting to see _a little more_ wildlife in the reserve, but such is the nature of nature; it doesn't always come out to play. At the end of the day, we got what we came for: quetzals. We did also see a couple of different toucan species, some howler monkeys, various butterfly species and a handful of other birds that I can't remember the name of.

## Ziplining and Ficus Root Bridge

Santa Elena is pretty small. We were pretty conscious of how expensive some of the activities here are so we didn't go out to eat or drink. Our hostel had a pretty good kitchen so we whipped up some basic meals to save money.

One of those fund-draining activities is ziplining through the cloud forest canopy. There were a two or three different providers who operate in different local forests. I believe we ended up going to Selvatura Park. It was pretty fun but I didn't feel like it was some once-in-a-lifetime experience.

We also went to the local (free) attraction, the Ficus Root Bridge. It's a short walk from the center. We went down some inconspicuous path into the forest which ran alongside a stream. The ficus tree had sprawled its root(s) across the small chasm, creating a natural bridge over the stream. It unfortunately didn't lead anywhere, but it did make for great Tarzan-esque pictures!

<br/>

That's mostly it for Monteverde. At this point we had made plans to go to most southern parts of the country in order to spend 10 days at a turtle conservation eco project, as well as visit the infamous Corcovado National Park, all of it detailed in the next part.
